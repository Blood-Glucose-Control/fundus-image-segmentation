- Color space modifications (brightness, contrast, hue)
- Noise injection and blurring for robustness

### 3. Percentage Calculation
Accurate computation of affected area percentage:
```python
percentage = (affected_pixels / total_pixels) × 100
```

scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(
    optimizer, mode='min', 
    factor=0.5, patience=5
