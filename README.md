### Teams

#### Segmentation Team
- Focused on analyzing medical images to isolate important regions such as lesions, optic discs, and other retinal structures.
- This step improves the precision of downstream models by providing clean, labeled inputs for training and evaluation.



#### Model Blending Team
- Involves integrating the predictions of multiple deep learning architectures to enhance overall accuracy and robustness.
- By combining results from different models and datasets, the blended approach aims to achieve more reliable progression prediction and classification outcomes.
